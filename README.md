# FactorLens: Full-Stack Fama-French Factor Analysis Platform

## Overview

A full-stack quantitative finance application using Spring Boot (Java 21), React, PostgreSQL, and Python to perform Fama-French five-factor analysis on a user's stock portfolio.

**Learning Focus**: Spring Boot, PostgreSQL (Docker), and React. Python handles the quant logic.

---

## How This Project Works

User signs up → adds stock holdings (ticker + quantity) → clicks "Run Analysis" → sees results.

Behind the scenes: Spring Boot sends the holdings to a Python Flask service. Flask fetches historical prices from Yahoo Finance, retrieves Fama-French factor data, runs an OLS regression, and returns factor exposures (betas), alpha, and R-squared. Results are stored in PostgreSQL and displayed as charts in React.

## Project Explanation (For Non-Finance People)

**What is this project?**

Imagine you own some stocks (like Apple, Tesla, Amazon). You want to understand *why* your portfolio goes up or down. Is it because:
- The whole stock market went up? (Market risk)
- You own small companies that did well? (Size risk)
- You own "cheap" stocks that recovered? (Value risk)
- You own profitable companies? (Profitability)
- You own companies that don't spend much on expansion? (Investment style)

This project uses a famous academic model called the **Fama-French Five-Factor Model** to break down your portfolio's performance into these 5 categories. It's like a nutrition label for your investments—instead of showing calories and protein, it shows how much of your returns came from each "risk factor."

**The Five Factors:**
| Factor | What it measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| MKT-RF (Market) | How much your portfolio moves with the overall market |
| SMB (Size) | Exposure to small companies vs large companies |
| HML (Value) | Exposure to "cheap" stocks vs "expensive" growth stocks |
| RMW (Profitability) | Exposure to highly profitable companies |
| CMA (Investment) | Exposure to conservative vs aggressive companies |

**Why is this useful?**
- If 90% of your risk comes from "small companies," you know you're heavily exposed if small companies crash
- You can see if you're actually skilled at picking stocks (alpha) or just riding market waves
- Professional fund managers use this exact analysis to understand their portfolios

**Communication Flow:**
1. React UI → Spring Boot (JWT authenticated REST)
2. Spring Boot → Python Flask (analysis requests)
3. Flask → yfinance/Ken French data library
4. Results stored in PostgreSQL

## Database Schema

**Design**: Each user has exactly **one portfolio**. User adds holdings (ticker + quantity), clicks "Run Analysis", sees results.

### Entity Relationships

```
User (1) ──────────── (N) Holding
User (1) ──────────── (N) FactorAnalysisResult
FamaFrenchFactor (standalone - cached data)
```

### Entities

**User** - Account info
| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| id | Primary key (UUID) |
| email | Login identifier |
| passwordHash | BCrypt-hashed password |
| role | USER or ADMIN |

**Holding** - A stock position in the user's portfolio
| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| id | Primary key |
| userId | FK to User |
| ticker | Stock symbol (e.g., "AAPL") |
| quantity | Number of shares owned |

**FamaFrenchFactor** - Cached factor data from Ken French's library
| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| id | Primary key |
| factorDate | Date for this data point |
| mktRf, smb, hml, rmw, cma, rf | The 5 factor values + risk-free rate |

**FactorAnalysisResult** - Saved analysis output
| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| id | Primary key |
| userId | FK to User |
| analysisDate | When analysis was run |
| alpha | Excess return (stock-picking skill) |
| betaMkt, betaSmb, betaHml, betaRmw, betaCma | Factor exposures |
| rSquared | How much the factors explain (0-1) |
